# Dao

The top priority for any build delivering the content and overall message to *any* device, keeping the site responsive and accessbile; optimising is not making sure the site looks nice on one device or when resizing the browser – this is bad practice.

Supporting devices and platforms means delivering content, making sure it's accessible, but not necessarily functioning the same. Performance is key and something that impacts the experience – speed over nice-to-haves…always.

Progressive enhancement is the additional layer of functionality and good looks that would be required to make the site stand out.

Sometimes projects can be a little too ambitious when it comes to both designing and building a site, device-agnostic (responsive) or not.

A site can be both simple and give an amazing experience, if things are approached sensibly. Trying to do too much 'awesome' stuff means your codebase can quickly go out the window and become unmaintainable if the developer doesn't know what they're doing.
