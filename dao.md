# Dao

The top priority for any build delivering the content and overall message to *any* device, keeping the site responsive and accessbile; optimising is not making sure the site looks nice on one device or when resizing the browser – this is bad practice.

Supporting devices and platforms means delivering content, making sure it's accessible, but not necessarily functioning the same. Performance is key and something that impacts the experience – speed over nice-to-haves, always.

Progressive enahancement is the additional layer of functionality and good looks that would be required to make the site stand out.
