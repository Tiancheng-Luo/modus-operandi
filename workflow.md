# Workflow

## Prototyping
I use a [Yeoman generator of my own](https://github.com/adamcbrewer/generator-launchpad/) to kickstart the prototyping phase. I dictate what I need from this and can be up and running within 5 minutes.

## Tools

### SASS
Regarding CSS, I used to be a LESS fan, but have converted to SASS, however I'm comfortable using any framework/preprocessor.

I try to avoid using third-party frameworks unless needed, as I don't fully trust how often the source code is updated or how reliable any of them are. I prefer to keep my own [selection of mixins, functions and helper classes](https://github.com/adamcbrewer/generator-launchpad/tree/master/app/templates/assets/css/sass) – which I regularly update – borrowing from various sources. With this I know that everything is used and reliable.
