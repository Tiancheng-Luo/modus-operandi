# Politely Decline

Good afternoon [name],

I hope you had a great weekend.

Thanks for sending the brief over. It sounds very interesting indeed, and I can see there being a big market for such a product. Unfortunately, I won't be able to work on this as the subject isn't something that would be complimentary to the style and type of work which I do. I'm sure you understand. My schedule is also quite full at the moment and therefore wouldn't have the appropriate time to dedicate to such a project.

However, thanks again for getting in touch. I wish you great success with it.

All the best!
