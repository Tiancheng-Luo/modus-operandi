# First Contact

Hi [name]!

Thanks for reaching out. I'd love to talk to you about [project] and try to see if there's a good fit between our two companies.

May I ask your to answer a few questions for me so I can learn a bit more before we schedule a call?

1. Tell me a little about why you're looking to start this project? And what business goals do you have in mind after you successfully execute this?
2. Do you have a budget you've set aside for this project? And is it over Â£XX,XXX?
3. When are you looking to get started on this project?
4. Are you the owner of this project? And should we plan on inviting other members of your team to the initial consult?
5. Is this a new type of project for your company, or have you done it before?
Next steps would be to pencil in a time where we can meet and go over your business and ways I could help this project fulfill your business goals.
Cheers!
