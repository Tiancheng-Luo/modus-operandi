# Manifesto

To focus on front-end performance, CSS architecture, scalability, pragmatism, and product-led development.

Top priority is delivering the content and message to any device, keeping the site responsive and accessbile.

Optimising is not making sure the site looks nice on one device or when resizing the browser – using only this as a means of feedback I consider bad practice.

Supporting devices and platforms means delivering content, making sure it's accessible, but not necessarily functioning the same; there's a large separation of browser abilities out there.

Progressive enhancement is an additional layer of functionality and pimping that would be required to make the site stand out. In terms of performance, it's something extremely important and which can impact the experience in both good and bad ways.

A site can be both simple and give an amazing experience if things are given enough thought and approached sensibly. Trying to do too much could mean the code-base suffers and can quickly become unmaintainable.

I feel a stronger inclination to work on smaller, more bespoke sites and builds where I can have direct contact with the client – sometimes adding more people and organisers confuses things and you lose the real objective of the project.

I love to tinker with personal projects; either to learn something new, to refine part of my workflow, or just for the sake of it to test something out. Most of my work is published on GitHub as I love the idea of openness.
